# model-training
Contains the ML training pipeline. 

# Training Repository

This repository is dedicated to storing all training-related files for the Machine Learning (ML) part of the course. For now, simply add all relevant files here. 

## Requirements

- [ ] Identify the set of requirements and create a `requirements.txt` file to list all necessary dependencies.

## Training a Model

- [ ] Identify the required steps to train a model.
- [ ] Save the trained model in an accessible location, so it can be integrated into the `model-service`.

**Note:** At this stage, no automation is required for model training.

## Pre-processing

- [ ] A major goal of this project is to factor out the pre-processing step and make it reusable in the `model-service`. Ensure that the pre-processing code is modular and can be easily integrated into other parts of the project.
